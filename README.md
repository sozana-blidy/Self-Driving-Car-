This work contains of three stages:
1- create Multi-task learning CNN model from scratch to classify traffic signs and traffic lights.
2- create region of interest model using YOLOv4 to extract road signs from street view.
3- Add multi layer perceptron to make the model able to make decision.
The datasets I used are LISA and GTSRB dataset in the links below:
